## Developer Instructions
To get started, navigate to the root directory and run:

```shell
$ npm install
```

For development, open `public/dist/index.html` in your browser then run:

```shell
npm run watch
```

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/) should then re-build all files linked to from `public/src/index.ts` on new changes and you should be able to refresh to see new changes.
